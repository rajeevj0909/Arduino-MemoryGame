# INS: Instructions

To install, please run program with the setup_leaderboard() function running inside of the setup function on line 62. 
Once this has been ran once, it can be commented back out again.

# MFS: Features of the minimal feature set

Indicate by deleting YES or NO to the questions below.
If partially implemented, describe this by deleting *YES/NO* and
writing what does work.  Do not adjust any other text in this section.

* Sequences are displayed on the screen as specified: *YES*
* Backlight flashes (only when correct): *YES*
* Incorrect answer leads to game over: *YES*
* Game supports *N* up to 10: *YES*
* Game supports *M* of size 4: *YES*
* A menu is present: *YES*
* Size of *M* can be changed: *YES*
* *N* can be changed: *YES*
* Message when wrong printed: *YES*

# OAF: Optional and additional features

* I have chosen to use delay in some places as it was appropriate that I didn't want the user to be able to interact with the game during the delay.
* I have chosen to make the practice mode endless instead of a single round. 
This is because "practice" needs more than 1 round and we were told a bit late. It does remember the previous settings when practice mode is re-entered.
* I have chosen to not allow for difficulty settings in story mode as the worth of a "score" is different in each setting and would not be fair on the leaderboard.
* Handling sequences N that are longer than 10
* A time limit T for inputting the next character
* Story mode increases difficulty
* A full working menu is present
* Selectable difficulty levels present for practice mode
* Custom characters are present (including a 2x2 character- a sad face)
* Suitable displays for winning and losing are present
* A high score table written to the EEPROM is present
* A way for the winner of a high score to enter 3 initials is present
* I have created a function which allows the scrolling of the top line while keeping the bottom static.

# TPL: Test plan

And the test plan goes here.  Assume the code is booted and running.
What buttons should be pushed and what should be observed.  Again you
can use numbers or asterisks for a bulleted/numbered list.

E.g.
1. Press left
2. Observe Menu
3. etc


PLEASE do NOT change the lines that start with hashes.
